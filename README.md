# big-diffr
Compare consecutive revisions with smart inline diffing - ignores whitespace and blank lines.

If you are working iteratively, say, an unreliable coding partner—say, someone who can very quickly revise your code in complex ways for you, but is not trustworthy to at the same time silently introduce changes, deletions, or regression errors into unrelated parts of your code for you to joyfully stumbled upon weeks later, as so many of us experience nowadays—you need a way to very quickly see an overview of diffs between a long series of versions so you can be aware of any unwanted changes as they occur. This tool does that.

Also has the ability to save and restore sessions so you can come back to previous sessions. 

Currently in alpha but mostly works.
